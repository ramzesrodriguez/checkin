A free and open source Android app for posting your current update to your followers. It uses an approximation of your current location and plots it on a map. You can also see your followers recently updated statuses.
 
**Note:** This is an educational and exploratory code base to facilitate learning new Android development patterns and the Kotlin programming language features. Though the intention is to release it on the app store at some point, it's not the ultimate goal. This will stay forever as a work in progress.
